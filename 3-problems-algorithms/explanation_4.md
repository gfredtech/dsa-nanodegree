# Problem 4

Again, we're applying a sort on values similar to the
binary search concepts applied in some of the previous problems.
The function continues to iterate through the array by placing
values on the respective left and right of a middle value.
Because we're dealing with a very limited set of possible numbers,
we're able to apply some simpler, more direct processing based
on the conditional value.
Time complexity is O(n) Because the runtime grows as a function of the input size
Space complexity is O(1)
