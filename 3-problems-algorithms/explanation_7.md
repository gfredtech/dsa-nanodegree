# Problem 7

This problem again makes use of a trie to iterate through
web pages. Again, because a trie is like
the tree, it is well suited to handle computational
complexity well.
Just like our other problem with the trie,
we make simple use of iterating through the trie via single traversals.
The only kicker in a function like this is, naturally, as the
input data grows, so too does the computational complexity in linear proportion.
That said, our final problem here has a Big O of O(n).
Similarly, the spacial complexity of this trie only grows in proportion to
however big the input dataset is, so again, we're also looking at a
Big O of O(n).
